I have always loved the Field of Data Engineering, Now I have started to study from the basics.

Some of the things I found Important(below I have divided them into sections):
    Statistical Analysis & modeling
    Hadoop-based Tech (MapReduce, Hive, Pig)
    SQL(MY SQL)
    NoSQL tech(Cassandra, MongoDB)
    Database architucture
    Data Modeling (ERWin, VIsio)
    C++, Java, Python
    Matlab, SAS, R
    Data warehousing
    Predictive modeling(NLP, Text Analysis)
    Machine Learning
    Data mining
    Unix, windows


I Have divided the subjects from above into 4 main sections(might change as time goes by)

 1-Data Analysis:
      MapReduce, Hadoop(Cloudera, IBM big, MapR)
      Data Mining & machine learning(Mahout & nerual Networks)
      Statistical Analysis(R, SPSS, SAS, MATLAB)
      Programming(C++, Scala, python, Java)
    
  2-Data Warehousing:
      Relational(MySQL, Oracle)
      NoSQL(Cassandara, MongoDB)
    
  3-Data Collection
      RESTful
      SQL

  4-Data Transformation
      ELT TOOLS(SSIS, Redpoint, Data Stage)
      Scripting
      
  I will study through Projects, books and videos. 
  I will create Flash cards after each day of studying to ensure a continues review as I Complete Different Sections
